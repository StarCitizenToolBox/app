### ✨ Feature
- Localization management: install the localization of the community and switch languages with one click

- Website Localization: Provide manual translation for the Star Citizen official website and Star Citizen tool website (thanks to the Star Citizen Chinese Encyclopedia project), and also provide [Browser Extension (Github)] (https://github.com/xkeyC/StarCitizenBoxBrowserEx).
- Performance optimization: Add more detailed performance parameter control to the Star Citizen game, which can be used to optimize performance and obtain better image quality.
